Subject: [PATCH 0961/1002] ARM: dts: Set all RPi PWM clocks to 50MHz

With the RP1 PWM configured to use the 50MHz oscillator clock source,
requesting a 100MHz clock will fail. Set the RP1 PWM clock rate to
50MHz, do the same to other Pi PWM blocks, and remove the default
clock override in the PWM overlays. However, an explicit
"clock=..." parameter is still supported.
