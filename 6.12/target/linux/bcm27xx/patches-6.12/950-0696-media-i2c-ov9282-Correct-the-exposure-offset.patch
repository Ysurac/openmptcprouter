Subject: [PATCH 696/697] media: i2c: ov9282: Correct the exposure offset

The datasheet lists that "Maximum exposure time is frame
length -25 row periods, where frame length is set by
registers {0x380E, 0x380F}".
However this driver had OV9282_EXPOSURE_OFFSET set to 12
which allowed that restriction to be violated, and would
result in very under-exposed images.

Correct the offset.
