 * phys_size_t initdram(int board_type)

 * As the name already indicates, this function is called very early
 * from start.S and configures the SDRAM with fixed values. This is needed,
 * since the 440EP has no internal SRAM and the 4kB NAND_SPL loader has
 * not enough free space to implement the complete I2C SPD DDR autodetection
 * routines. Therefore the Bamboo only supports the onboard 64MBytes of SDRAM
 * when booting from NAND flash.
 *
 * Note:
 * As found out by Eugene O'Brien <eugene.obrien@advantechamt.com>, the fixed
 * DDR setup has problems (U-Boot crashes randomly upon TFTP), when the DIMM
 * modules are still plugged in. So it is recommended to remove the DIMM
 * modules while using the NAND booting code with the fixed SDRAM setup!
