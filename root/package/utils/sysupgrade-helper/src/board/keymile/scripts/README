into your tftp root directory to be able to use this scripts.
cp -r <u-boot-repo>/board/keymile/scripts <your_tftp_root>/

To load and configure these usecase, two environment variables in the u-boot
default environment must be parsed:
run develop : setup environment to configure for rootfs via nfs
run ramfs   : setup environment to configure for rootfs in ram
