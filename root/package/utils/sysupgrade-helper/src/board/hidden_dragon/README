U-Boot for Hidden Dragon board
------------------------------

Hidden Dragon is a MPC824x-based board by Motorola. For the most
part it is similar to Sandpoint8245 board. So unless otherwise
mentioned, the codes in this directory are adapted from ../sandpoint
directory.

Apparently there are very few of this board out there. Even Motorola
website does not have any info on it.

RAM:
  start = 0x0000 0000
  size	= 0x0200 0000 (32 MB)

Flash:
  BANK ONE:
    start = 0xFFE0 0000
    size  = 0x0020 0000 (2 MB)
    flash chip = 29LV160TE (1x16 Mbits or 2x8 Mbits)
    flash sectors = 16K, 2x8K, 32K, 31x64K

  BANK TWO:
    NONE

The processor interrupt vectors reside on the first 256 bytes
starting from address 0xFFF00000. The "reset vector" (first
instruction executed after reset) is located on 0xFFF0 0100.

U-Boot is configured to reside in flash starting at the address of
0xFFF00000. The environment space is located in flash separately from
U-Boot, at the second sector of the first flash bank, starting from
0xFFE04000 until 0xFFE06000 (8KB).

Network:
  - RTL8139 chip on the base board	  (SUPPORTED)
  - RTL8129 chip on the processor board	  (NOT SUPPORTED)

Serial:
  - Two NS16550 compatible UART on the processor board	(SUPPORTED)
  - One NS16550 compatible UART on the base board	(UNTESTED)

Misc:
  VIA686A PCI SuperIO peripheral controller
  - 2 USB ports		    (UNTESTED)
  - 2 PS2 ports		    (UNTESTED)
  - Parallel port	    (UNTESTED)
  - IDE & floppy interface  (UNTESTED)

  S3 Savage4 video card	    (UNTESTED)

TODO:
-----
- Support for the VIA686A based peripherals
- The RTL8139 driver frequently gives rx error.
- Support for RTL8129 network controller. (Why is the support removed from
  rtl8139.c driver?)
