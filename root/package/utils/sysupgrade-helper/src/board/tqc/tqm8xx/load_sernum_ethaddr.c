 * Process Hardware Information Block:

 * If we boot on a system fresh from factory, check if the Hardware
 * Information Block exists and save the information it contains.
 *
 * The TQM8xxL / TQM82xx Hardware Information Block is defined as
 * follows:
 * - located in first flash bank
 * - starts at offset 0x0003FFC0
 * - size 0x00000040
 *
 * Internal structure:
 * - sequence of ASCII character strings
 * - fields separated by a single space character (0x20)
 * - last field terminated by NUL character (0x00)
 * - remaining space filled with NUL characters (0x00)
 *
 * Fields in Hardware Information Block:
 * 1) Module Type
 * 2) Serial Number
 * 3) First MAC Address
 * 4) Number of additional MAC addresses
