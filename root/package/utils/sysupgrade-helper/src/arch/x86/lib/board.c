/*
 * Breath some life into the board...
 *
 * Getting the board up and running is a three-stage process:
 *  1) Execute from Flash, SDRAM Uninitialised
 *     At this point, there is a limited amount of non-SDRAM memory
 *     (typically the CPU cache, but can also be SRAM or even a buffer of
 *     of some peripheral). This limited memory is used to hold:
 *      - The initial copy of the Global Data Structure
 *      - A temporary stack
 *      - A temporary x86 Global Descriptor Table
 *      - The pre-console buffer (if enabled)
 *
 *     The following is performed during this phase of execution:
 *      - Core low-level CPU initialisation
 *      - Console initialisation
 *      - SDRAM initialisation
 *
 *  2) Execute from Flash, SDRAM Initialised
 *     At this point we copy Global Data from the initial non-SDRAM
 *     memory and set up the permanent stack in SDRAM. The CPU cache is no
 *     longer being used as temporary memory, so we can now fully enable
 *     it.
 *
 *     The following is performed during this phase of execution:
 *      - Create final stack in SDRAM
 *      - Copy Global Data from temporary memory to SDRAM
 *      - Enabling of CPU cache(s),
 *      - Copying of U-Boot code and data from Flash to RAM
 *      - Clearing of the BSS
 *      - ELF relocation adjustments
 *
 *  3) Execute from SDRAM
 *     The following is performed during this phase of execution:
 *      - All remaining initialisation
