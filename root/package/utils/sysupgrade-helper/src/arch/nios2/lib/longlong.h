   UWtype -- An unsigned type, default type for operations (typically a "word")
   UHWtype -- An unsigned type, at least half the size of UWtype.
   UDWtype -- An unsigned type, at least twice as large a UWtype
   W_TYPE_SIZE -- size in bits of UWtype

   UQItype -- Unsigned 8 bit type.
   SItype, USItype -- Signed and unsigned 32 bit types.

/* Define auxiliary asm macros.

   1) umul_ppmm(high_prod, low_prod, multiplier, multiplicand) multiplies two
   UWtype integers MULTIPLIER and MULTIPLICAND, and generates a two UWtype
   word product in HIGH_PROD and LOW_PROD.

   2) __umulsidi3(a,b) multiplies two UWtype integers A and B, and returns a
   UDWtype product.  This is just a variant of umul_ppmm.

   3) udiv_qrnnd(quotient, remainder, high_numerator, low_numerator,
   denominator) divides a UDWtype, composed by the UWtype integers
   HIGH_NUMERATOR and LOW_NUMERATOR, by DENOMINATOR and places the quotient
   in QUOTIENT and the remainder in REMAINDER.  HIGH_NUMERATOR must be less
   than DENOMINATOR for correct operation.  If, in addition, the most
   significant bit of DENOMINATOR must be 1, then the pre-processor symbol
   UDIV_NEEDS_NORMALIZATION is defined to 1.

   4) sdiv_qrnnd(quotient, remainder, high_numerator, low_numerator,
   denominator).  Like udiv_qrnnd but the numbers are signed.  The quotient
   is rounded towards 0.

   5) count_leading_zeros(count, x) counts the number of zero-bits from the
   msb to the first nonzero bit in the UWtype X.  This is the number of
   steps X needs to be shifted left to set the msb.  Undefined for X == 0,
   unless the symbol COUNT_LEADING_ZEROS_0 is defined to some value.

   6) count_trailing_zeros(count, x) like count_leading_zeros, but counts
   from the least significant end.

   7) add_ssaaaa(high_sum, low_sum, high_addend_1, low_addend_1,
   high_addend_2, low_addend_2) adds two UWtype integers, composed by
   HIGH_ADDEND_1 and LOW_ADDEND_1, and HIGH_ADDEND_2 and LOW_ADDEND_2
   respectively.  The result is placed in HIGH_SUM and LOW_SUM.  Overflow
   (i.e. carry out) is not stored anywhere, and is lost.

   8) sub_ddmmss(high_difference, low_difference, high_minuend, low_minuend,
   high_subtrahend, low_subtrahend) subtracts two two-word UWtype integers,
   composed by HIGH_MINUEND_1 and LOW_MINUEND_1, and HIGH_SUBTRAHEND_2 and
   LOW_SUBTRAHEND_2 respectively.  The result is placed in HIGH_DIFFERENCE
   and LOW_DIFFERENCE.  Overflow (i.e. carry out) is not stored anywhere,
   and is lost.

   If any of these macros are left undefined for a particular CPU,
   C macros are used.  */
