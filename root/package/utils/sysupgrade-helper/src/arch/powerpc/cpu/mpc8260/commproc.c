 * channels, there are a few functions that globally affect the
 * communication processor.
 *
 * Buffer descriptors must be allocated from the dual ported memory
 * space.  The allocator for that is here.  When the communication
 * process is reset, we reclaim the memory available.  There is
 * currently no deallocator for this memory.
