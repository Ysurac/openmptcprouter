 * table provided as a parameter to the function. As a result cells are
 * sent to the underlaying hardware for transmission.
 *
 * The schedule table is executed in its entirety or not at all. So the

 * can be transmitted at that point. The maximum numbers that can be
 * transmitted is guaranteed to be the number of cells as returned by the
 * function @a ixAtmdAccPortTxFreeEntriesQuery().
 *
 * When the scheduler is invoked on a threshold level, IxAtmdAcc gives the
 * minimum number of cells (to ensure the callback will fire again later)
 * and the maximum number of cells that @a ixAtmdAccPortTxProcess()
 * will be able to process (assuming the ATM scheduler is able
 * to produce the worst-case schedule table, i.e. one entry per cell).
 *
 * When invoked ouside a threshold level, the overall number of cells of
 * the schedule table should be less than the number of cells returned
 * by the @a ixAtmdAccPortTxFreeEntriesQuery() function.
 *
 * After invoking the @a ixAtmdAccPortTxProcess() function, it is the
 * user choice to query again the queue level with the function
 * @a ixAtmdAccPortTxFreeEntriesQuery() and, depending on a new cell
 * number, submit an other schedule table.
 *
 * IxAtmdAcc will check that the number of cells in the schedule table
 * is compatible with the current transmit level. If the
