Device Tree Bindings Staging Area
=================================

This directory contains device tree bindings for U-Boot.

These follow along with Linux kernel bindings, with a few additions. By
adding the files here, U-Boot patches can clearly show thees additions.
This makes it easier for device tree people to review these additions in
patches sent to the U-Boot mailing list.

The intent IS to commit these files to U-Boot. Hopefully at some point
the files will be stored in another repo (shared with Linux) which is
brought in as needed. Changes here are intended to mirror changes in the
Linux Documentation/devicetree/bindings/ directory.
