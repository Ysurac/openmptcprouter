.TH MKIMAGE 1 "2010-05-16"

.SH NAME
mkimage \- Generate image for U-Boot
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mkimage
.RB [\fIoptions\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The
.B mkimage
command is used to create images for use with the U-Boot boot loader.
These images can contain the linux kernel, device tree blob, root file
system image, firmware images etc., either separate or combined.

.B mkimage
supports two different formats:

The old
.I legacy image
format concatenates the individual parts (for example, kernel image,
device tree blob and ramdisk image) and adds a 64 bytes header
containing information about target architecture, operating system,
image type, compression method, entry points, time stamp, checksums,
etc.

The new
.I FIT (Flattened Image Tree) format
allows for more flexibility in handling images of various types and also
enhances integrity protection of images with stronger checksums.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.B List image information:

.TP
.BI "\-l [" "uimage file name" "]"
mkimage lists the information contained in the header of an existing U-Boot image.

.P
.B Create old legacy image:

.TP
.BI "\-A [" "architecture" "]"
Set architecture. Pass \-h as the architecture to see the list of supported architectures.

.TP
.BI "\-O [" "os" "]"
Set operating system. bootm command of u-boot changes boot method by os type.
Pass \-h as the OS to see the list of supported OS.

.TP
.BI "\-T [" "image type" "]"
Set image type.
Pass \-h as the image to see the list of supported image type.

.TP
.BI "\-C [" "compression type" "]"
Set compression type.
Pass \-h as the compression to see the list of supported compression type.

.TP
.BI "\-a [" "load addess" "]"
Set load address with a hex number.

.TP
.BI "\-e [" "entry point" "]"
Set entry point with a hex number.

.TP
.BI "\-n [" "image name" "]"
Set image name to 'image name'.

.TP
.BI "\-d [" "image data file" "]"
Use image data from 'image data file'.

.TP
.BI "\-x"
Set XIP (execute in place) flag.

.P
.B Create FIT image:

.TP
.BI "\-D [" "dtc options" "]"
Provide special options to the device tree compiler that is used to
create the image.

.TP
.BI "\-f [" "image tree source file" "]"
Image tree source file that describes the structure and contents of the
FIT image.

.SH EXAMPLES

List image information:
.nf

.fi
.P
Create FIT image with compressed PowerPC Linux kernel:
.nf
.B mkimage -f kernel.its kernel.itb
.fi
