Matrix Vision mvSMR
-------------------

1.	Board Description

	The mvSMR is a 75x130mm single image processing board used
	in automation. Power Supply is 24VDC.

2	System Components

2.1	CPU
	Freescale MPC5200B CPU running at 400MHz core and 133MHz XLB/IPB.
	64MB DDR-I @ 133MHz.
	8 MByte Nor Flash on local bus.
	2 serial ports. Console running on ttyS0 @ 115200 8N1.

2.2	PCI
	PCI clock fixed at 33MHz due to old'n'slow Xilinx PCI core.

2.3	FPGA
	Xilinx Spartan-3 XC3S200 with PCI DMA engine.
	Connects to Matrix Vision specific CCD/CMOS sensor interface.

2.4	I2C
	EEPROM @ 0xA0 for vendor specifics.
	image sensor interface (slave addresses depend on sensor)

3	Flash layout.

	reset vector is 0x00000100, i.e. "LOWBOOT".

	FF800000	u-boot
	FF806000	u-boot script image
	FF808000	u-boot environment
	FF840000	FPGA raw bit file
	FF880000	root FS
	FFF00000	kernel

4	Booting

	On startup the bootscript @ FF806000 is executed. This script can be
	exchanged easily. Default boot mode is "boot from flash", i.e. system
	works stand-alone.

	This behaviour depends on some environment variables :

	"netboot" : yes ->try dhcp/bootp and boot from network.
	A "dhcp_client_id" and "dhcp_vendor-class-identifier" can be used for
	DHCP server configuration, e.g. to provide different images to
	different devices.

	During netboot the system tries to get 3 image files:
	1. Kernel - name + data is given during BOOTP.
	2. Initrd - name is stored in "initrd_name"
	Fallback files are the flash versions.
