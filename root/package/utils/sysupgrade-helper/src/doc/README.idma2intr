Attached is an IDMA example code for MPC8260/PPCBoot. I had tried to
search around and could not find any for implementing IDMA, so
implemented one. Its not coded in the best way, but works.

Also, I was able to test the IDMA specific code under Linux also
(with modifications). My requirement was to implement it for
CompactFlash implemented in memory mode, and it works for it under
PPCBoot and Linux.
