_armboot_start contains the value of CONFIG_SYS_TEXT_BASE (0xA07E0000); it seems
CONFIG_SYS_TEXT_BASE and _armboot_start are both used for the same purpose in
different parts of the (ARM) code.
Furthermore, the startup code (cpu/<arm>/start.S) internally uses
another variable (_TEXT_BASE) with the same content as _armboot_start.
I agree that this mess should be cleaned up.
