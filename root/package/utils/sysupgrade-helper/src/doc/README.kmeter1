Keymile kmeter1 Board
-----------------------------------------
1.	Alternative Boot EEPROM

    Upon the kmeter1 startup the I2C_1 controller is used to fetch the boot
    configuration from a serial EEPROM. During the development and debugging
    phase it might be helpful to apply an alternative boot configuration in
    a simple way. Therefore it is an alternative boot eeprom on the PIGGY,
    which can be activated by setting the "ST" jumper on the PIGGY board.

2.	Memory Map

    BaseAddr    PortSz  Size  Device
    ----------- ------  -----  ------
    0x0000_0000 64 bit  256MB  DDR
    0x8000_0000  8 bit  256KB  GPIO/PIGGY on CS1
    0xa000_0000  8 bit  256MB  PAXE on CS3
    0xe000_0000           2MB  Int Mem Reg Space
    0xf000_0000 16 bit  256MB  FLASH on CS0


    DDR-SDRAM:
    The current realization is made with four 16-bits memory devices.
    Mounting options have been foreseen for device architectures from
    4Mx16 to 512Mx16. The kmeter1 is equipped with four 32Mx16 devices
    thus resulting in a total capacity of 256MBytes.

3. Compilation

	Assuming you're using BASH shell:

		export CROSS_COMPILE=your-cross-compile-prefix
		cd u-boot
		make distclean
		make kmeter1_config
		make

4. Downloading and Flashing Images

4.0 Download over serial line using Kermit:

	loadb
	[Drop to kermit:
	    ^\c
	    send <u-boot-bin-image>
	    c
	]


    Or via tftp:

	tftp 10000 u-boot.bin
    => run load
    Using UEC0 device
    TFTP from server 192.168.1.1; our IP address is 192.168.205.4
    Filename '/tftpboot/kmeter1/u-boot.bin'.
    Load address: 0x200000
    Loading: ##############
