The EVB-64260-750CX is quite similar to the EVB-64260-BP already
supported except the following differences:
* It has an IBM-750CXe soldiered on board instead of the slot-1 in the
   BP.
* It has a single PCI male connector instead of the 4 PCI female
   connectors on the BP. It also gets power trough the PCI connector.
* It has only a single DIMM slot instead of the 2 slots in the BP.
