---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cleanup of AMCC eval boards (Walnut/Sycamore, Bubinga, Ebony, Ocotea)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes to all AMCC eval boards:
--------------------------------

o Changed u-boot image size to 256 kBytes instead of 512 kBytes on most
  boards.

o Use 115200 baud as default console baudrate.

o Added config option to use redundant environment in flash. This is also
  the default setting. Option for environment in nvram is still available
  for backward compatibility.

o Merged board specific flash drivers to common flash driver:
  board/amcc/common/flash.c


Sycamore/Walnut (one port supporting both eval boards):
-------------------------------------------------------

o Cleanup to allow easier "cloning" for different (custom) boards:

  o Moved EBC configuration from board specific asm-file "init.S"
    using defines in board configuration file. No board specific
    asm file needed anymore.
