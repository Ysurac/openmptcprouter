			   AMCC Ocotea Board

		    Last Update: March 2, 2004
=======================================================================

This file contains some handy info regarding U-Boot and the AMCC
Ocotea 440gx  evaluation board. See the README.ppc440 for additional
information.


SWITCH SETTINGS & JUMPERS
==========================

Here's what I've been using successfully. If you feel inclined to
change things ... please read the docs!

DIPSW   U46         U80
------------------------
SW 1    off         off
SW 2    on          off
SW 3    off         off
SW 4    off         off
SW 5    off         off
SW 6    on          on
SW 7    on          off
SW 8    on          off

J41: strapped
J42: open

All others are factory default.


I2C Information
=====================

See README.ebony for information.

PCI
===========================

Untested at the time of writing.

PPC440GX Ethernet EMACs
===========================

All EMAC ports have been tested and are known to work
with EPS Group 4.

Special note about the Cicada CIS8201:
	The CIS8201 Gigabit PHY comes up in GMII mode by default.
	One must hit an extended register to allow use of RGMII mode.
	This has been done in the 440gx_enet.c file with a #ifdef/endif
	pair.

AMCC does not store the EMAC ethernet addresses within their PIBS bootloader.
The addresses contained in the config header file are from my particular
board and you _*should*_ change them to reflect your board either in the
config file and/or in your environment variables.  I found the addresses on
labels on the bottom side of the board.


BDI2k or JTAG Debugging
===========================

For ease of debugging you can swap the small boot flash and external SRAM
by changing U46:3 to on.  You can then use the sram as your boot flash by
loading the sram via the jtag debugger.
