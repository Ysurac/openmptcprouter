Renesas R0P7757LC0030RL board
========================================

This board specification:
=========================

The R0P7757LC0030RL(board config name:sh7757lcr) has the following device:

 - SH7757 (SH-4A)
 - DDR3-SDRAM 256MB (with ECC)
 - SPI ROM 8MB
 - 2D Graphic controller
 - Ethernet controller
 - eMMC 2GB


configuration for This board:
=============================

You can select the configuration as follows:

 - make sh7785lcr_config


This board specific command:
============================

This board has the following its specific command:

 - sh_g200
 - write_mac


1. sh_g200

If we run this command, SH4 can control the G200.
The default setting is that SH4 cannot control the G200.


2. write_mac

You can write MAC address to SPI ROM.

 Usage 1) Write MAC address

   write_mac [ETHERC ch0] [ETHERC ch1] [GETHERC ch0] [GETHERC ch1]

	For example)
	 => write_mac 00:00:87:6c:21:80 00:00:87:6c:21:81 00:00:87:6c:21:82 00:00:87:6c:21:83
		*) We have to input the command as a single line
		   (without carriage return)
		*) We have to reset after input the command.

 Usage 2) Show current data

   write_mac

	For example)
		=> write_mac
		 ETHERC ch0 = 00:00:87:6c:21:80
		 ETHERC ch1 = 00:00:87:6c:21:81
		GETHERC ch0 = 00:00:87:6c:21:82
		GETHERC ch1 = 00:00:87:6c:21:83


Update SPI ROM:
============================

1. Copy u-boot image to RAM area.
2. Probe SPI device.
   => sf probe 0
   8192 KiB M25P64 at 0:0 is now current device
3. Erase SPI ROM.
   => sf erase 0 80000
4. Write u-boot image to SPI ROM.
   => sf write 0x89000000 0 80000
