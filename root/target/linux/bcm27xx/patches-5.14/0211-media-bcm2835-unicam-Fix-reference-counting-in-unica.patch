Subject: [PATCH 211/552] media: bcm2835-unicam: Fix reference counting in
 unicam_open

The reference counting of node->open was only incremented after
a check that the node was v4l2_fh_is_singular_file, which resulted
in the counting going wrong and s_power not being called at an
appropriate time.
