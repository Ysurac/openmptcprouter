Subject: [PATCH 064/552] brcm: adds support for BCM43341 wifi

brcmfmac: Disable power management

Disable wireless power saving in the brcmfmac WLAN driver. This is a
temporary measure until the connectivity loss resulting from power
saving is resolved.

brcmfmac: Use original country code as a fallback

Commit 73345fd212980d2e28a5c6d83801c903bd773680:

    brcmfmac: Configure country code using device specific settings

prevents region codes from working on devices that lack a region code
translation table. In the event of an absent table, preserve the old
behaviour of using the provided code as-is.

brcmfmac: do not use internal roaming engine by default

Some evidence of curing disconnects with this disabled, so make it a default.
Can be overridden with module parameter roamoff=0

Revert "brcmfmac: Disable power management"

Shortly after the release of the Pi 3B, a loss of SSH connectivity
over WiFi was traced to the power management handling, so power
management was disabled. And so it has remained ever since.

Enabling power management saves 55mA (~270mW) on a Pi 4B, so is very
much worth the minimal effort of reverting this patch, which was
squashed and rebased many times since then to the commit hash is
meaningless.
