Subject: [PATCH 781/828] drm/panel: Add prepare_upstream_first flag to
 drm_panel

Mapping to the drm_bridge flag pre_enable_upstream_first,
add a new flag prepare_upstream_first to drm_panel to allow
the panel driver to request that the upstream bridge should
be pre_enabled before the panel prepare.
